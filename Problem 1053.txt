1053. Journey
题目描述
There are n cities and n − 1 roads in the Seven Kingdoms, each road connects two cities and we can reach any city from any other by the roads.

Theon and Yara Greyjoy are on a horse in the first city, they are starting traveling through the roads. But the weather is foggy, so they can’t see where the horse brings them. When the horse reaches a city (including the first one), it goes to one of the cities connected to the current city. But it is a strange horse, it only goes to cities in which they weren't before. In each such city, the horse goes with equal probabilities and it stops when there are no such cities.

Let the length of each road be 1. The journey starts in the city 1. What is the expected length (expected value of length) of their journey?

输入格式
The first line contains a single integer n — number of cities. 
Then n - 1 lines follow. The i-th line of these lines contains two integers u[i] and v[i] (1 ≤ u[i], v[i] ≤ n) — the cities connected by the i-th road.

输出格式
Print a number — the expected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1.
